/**
 * A [[scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext]] implementation that can simulate async boundaries and
 * time passage, useful for law testing purposes. This is intended primarily for datatype
 * implementors. Most end-users will be better served by the `cats.effect.testkit.TestControl`
 * utility, rather than using `TestContext` directly.
 *
 * Usage for simulating an `ExecutionContext`):
 *
 * {{{
 *   implicit val ec = TestContext()
 *
 *   ec.execute(new Runnable { def run() = println("task1") })
 *
 *   ex.execute(new Runnable {
 *     def run() = {
 *       println("outer")
 *
 *       ec.execute(new Runnable {
 *         def run() = println("inner")
 *       })
 *     }
 *   })
 *
 *   // Nothing executes until `tick` gets called
 *   ec.tick()
 *
 *   // Testing the resulting state
 *   assert(ec.state.tasks.isEmpty)
 *   assert(ec.state.lastReportedFailure == None)
