title: Cyclic Barrier
---

A re-usable synchronization primitive that allows a set of
fibers to wait until they've all reached the same point.

```scala mdoc:silent

trait CyclicBarrier[F[_]] {

  def await: F[Unit]

}
```

A cyclic barrier is initialized with a positive integer `n` and
fibers which call `await` are semantically blocked until `n` of
them have invoked `await`, at which point all of them are unblocked
and the cyclic barrier is reset.

`await` cancelation is supported, in which case the number of
fibers required to unblock the cyclic barrier is incremented again.

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import cats.implicits._
import cats.effect._
import cats.effect.std.CyclicBarrier
import cats.effect.unsafe.implicits.global
import scala.concurrent.duration._

val run = (for {
  b <- CyclicBarrier[IO](2)
  f1 <- (IO.println("fast fiber before barrier") >>
      b.await >> 
      IO.println("fast fiber after barrier")
    ) .start
  f2 <- (IO.sleep(1.second) >>
      IO.println("slow fiber before barrier") >>
      IO.sleep(1.second) >>
      b.await >>
      IO.println("slow fiber after barrier")
    ).start
  _ <- (f1.join, f2.join).tupled
} yield ())

run.unsafeRunSync()
```
