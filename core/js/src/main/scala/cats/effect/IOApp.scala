/**
 * The primary entry point to a Cats Effect application. Extend this trait rather than defining
 * your own `main` method. This avoids the need to run [[IO.unsafeRunAsync]] (or similar) on
 * your own.
 *
 * `IOApp` takes care of the messy details of properly setting up (and tearing down) the
 * [[unsafe.IORuntime]] needed to run the [[IO]] which represents your application. All of the
 * associated thread pools (if relevant) will be configured with the assumption that your
 * application is fully contained within the `IO` produced by the [[run]] method. Note that the
 * exact details of how the runtime will be configured are very platform-specific. Part of the
 * point of `IOApp` is to insulate users from the details of the underlying runtime (whether JVM
 * or JavaScript).
 *
 * {{{
 *   object MyApplication extends IOApp {
 *     def run(args: List[String]) =
 *       for {
 *         _ <- IO.print("Enter your name: ")
 *         name <- IO.readln
 *         _ <- IO.println("Hello, " + name)
 *       } yield ExitCode.Success
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * In the above example, `MyApplication` will be a runnable class with a `main` method, visible
 * to Sbt, IntelliJ, or plain-old `java`. When run externally, it will print, read, and print in
 * the obvious way, producing a final process exit code of 0. Any exceptions thrown within the
 * `IO` will be printed to standard error and the exit code will be set to 1. In the event that
 * the main [[Fiber]] (represented by the `IO` returned by `run`) is canceled, the runtime will
 * produce an exit code of 1.
 *
 * Note that exit codes are an implementation-specific feature of the underlying runtime, as are
 * process arguments. Naturally, all JVMs support these functions, as does Node.js and Scala
 * Native, but some JavaScript execution environments will be unable to replicate these features
 * (or they simply may not make sense). In such cases, exit codes may be ignored and/or argument
 * lists may be empty.
 *
 * Note that in the case of the above example, we would actually be better off using
 * [[IOApp.Simple]] rather than `IOApp` directly, since we are neither using `args` nor are we
 * explicitly producing a custom [[ExitCode]]:
 *
 * {{{
 *   object MyApplication extends IOApp.Simple {
 *     val run =
 *       for {
 *         _ <- IO.print("Enter your name: ")
 *         name <- IO.readln
 *         _ <- IO.println(s"Hello, " + name)
 *       } yield ()
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * It is valid to define `val run` rather than `def run` because `IO`'s evaluation is lazy: it
 * will only run when the `main` method is invoked by the runtime.
 *
 * In the event that the process receives an interrupt signal (`SIGINT`) due to Ctrl-C (or any
 * other mechanism), it will immediately `cancel` the main fiber. Assuming this fiber is not
 * within an `uncancelable` region, this will result in interrupting any current activities and
 * immediately invoking any finalizers (see: [[IO.onCancel]] and [[IO.bracket]]). The process
 * will not shut down until the finalizers have completed. For example:
 *
 * {{{
 *   object InterruptExample extends IOApp.Simple {
 *     val run =
 *       IO.bracket(startServer)(
 *         _ => IO.never)(
 *         server => IO.println("shutting down") *> server.close)
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * If we assume the `startServer` function has type `IO[Server]` (or similar), this kind of
 * pattern is very common. When this process receives a `SIGINT`, it will immediately print
 * "shutting down" and run the `server.close` effect.
 *
 * One consequence of this design is it is possible to build applications which will ignore
 * process interrupts. For example, if `server.close` runs forever, the process will ignore
 * interrupts and will need to be cleaned up using `SIGKILL` (i.e. `kill -9`). This same
 * phenomenon can be demonstrated by using [[IO.uncancelable]] to suppress all interruption
 * within the application itself:
 *
 * {{{
 *   object Zombie extends IOApp.Simple {
 *     val run = IO.never.uncancelable
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * The above process will run forever and ignore all interrupts. The only way it will shut down
 * is if it receives `SIGKILL`.
 *
 * It is possible (though not necessary) to override various platform-specific runtime
 * configuration options, such as `computeWorkerThreadCount` (which only exists on the JVM).
 * Please note that the default configurations have been extensively benchmarked and are optimal
 * (or close to it) in most conventional scenarios.
 *
 * However, with that said, there really is no substitute to benchmarking your own application.
 * Every application and scenario is unique, and you will always get the absolute best results
 * by performing your own tuning rather than trusting someone else's defaults. `IOApp`'s
 * defaults are very ''good'', but they are not perfect in all cases. One common example of this
 * is applications which maintain network or file I/O worker threads which are under heavy load
 * in steady-state operations. In such a performance profile, it is usually better to reduce the
 * number of compute worker threads to "make room" for the I/O workers, such that they all sum
 * to the number of physical threads exposed by the kernel.
 *
 * @note
 *   While [[IOApp]] works perfectly fine for browser applications, in practice it brings little
 *   value over calling [[IO.unsafeRunAndForget]]. You can use your UI framework's preferred API
 *   for defining your application's entrypoint. On the other hand, Node.js applications must
 *   use [[IOApp]] to behave correctly.
