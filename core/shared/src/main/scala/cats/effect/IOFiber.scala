/*
 * Rationale on memory barrier exploitation in this class...
 *
 * This class extends `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicBoolean`
 * (through `IOFiberPlatform`) in order to forego the allocation
 * of a separate `AtomicBoolean` object. All credit goes to
 * Viktor Klang.
 * https://viktorklang.com/blog/Futures-in-Scala-2.12-part-8.html
 *
 * The runloop is held by a single thread at any moment in
 * time. This is ensured by the `suspended` AtomicBoolean,
 * which is set to `true` when evaluation of an `Async` causes
 * us to semantically block. Releasing the runloop can thus
 * only be done by passing through a write barrier (on `suspended`),
 * and relocating that runloop can itself only be achieved by
 * passing through that same read/write barrier (a CAS on
 * `suspended`).
 *
 * Separate from this, the runloop may be *relocated* to a different
 * thread â€“ for example, when evaluating Cede. When this happens,
 * we pass through a read/write barrier within the Executor as
 * we enqueue the action to restart the runloop, and then again
 * when that action is dequeued on the new thread. This ensures
 * that everything is appropriately published.
 *
 * By this argument, the `conts` stack is non-volatile and can be
 * safely implemented with an array. It is only accessed by one
 * thread at a time (so there are no atomicity concerns), and it
 * only becomes relevant to another thread after passing through
 * either an executor or the `suspended` gate, both of which
 * would ensure safe publication of writes. `ctxs`, `currentCtx`,
 * `masks`, `objectState`, and `booleanState` are all subject to
 * similar arguments. `cancel` and `join` are only made visible
 * by the Executor read/write barriers, but their writes are
 * merely a fast-path and are not necessary for correctness.
