/**
 * A monad that can describe asynchronous or synchronous computations
 * that produce exactly one result.
 *
 * ==On Asynchrony==
 *
 * An asynchronous task represents logic that executes independent of
 * the main program flow, or current callstack. It can be a task whose
 * result gets computed on another thread, or on some other machine on
 * the network.
 *
 * In terms of types, normally asynchronous processes are represented as:
 * {{{
 *   (A => Unit) => Unit
 * }}}
 *
 * This signature can be recognized in the "Observer pattern" described
 * in the "Gang of Four", although it should be noted that without
 * an `onComplete` event (like in the Rx Observable pattern) you can't
 * detect completion in case this callback can be called zero or
 * multiple times.
 *
 * Some abstractions allow for signaling an error condition
 * (e.g. `MonadError` data types), so this would be a signature
 * that's closer to Scala's `Future#onComplete`:
 *
 * {{{
 *   (Either[Throwable, A] => Unit) => Unit
 * }}}
 *
 * And many times the abstractions built to deal with asynchronous tasks
 * also provide a way to cancel such processes, to be used in race
 * conditions in order to cleanup resources early:
 *
 * {{{
 *   (A => Unit) => Cancelable
 * }}}
 *
 * This is approximately the signature of JavaScript's `setTimeout`,
 * which will return a "task ID" that can be used to cancel it.
 *
 * N.B. this type class in particular is NOT describing cancelable
 * async processes, see the [[Concurrent]] type class for that.
 *
 * ==Async Type class==
 *
 * This type class allows the modeling of data types that:
 *
 *  1. can start asynchronous processes
 *  1. can emit one result on completion
 *  1. can end in error
 *
 * N.B. on the "one result" signaling, this is not an ''exactly once''
 * requirement. At this point streaming types can implement `Async`
 * and such an ''exactly once'' requirement is only clear in [[Effect]].
 *
 * Therefore the signature exposed by the [[Async!.async async]]
 * builder is this:
 *
 * {{{
 *   (Either[Throwable, A] => Unit) => Unit
 * }}}
 *
 * N.B. such asynchronous processes are not cancelable.
 * See the [[Concurrent]] alternative for that.
