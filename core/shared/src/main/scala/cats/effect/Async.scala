/**
 * A monad that can describe asynchronous or synchronous computations
 * that produce exactly one result.
 *
 * ==On Asynchrony==
 *
 * An asynchronous task represents logic that executes independent of
 * the main program flow, or current callstack. It can be a task whose
 * result gets computed on another thread, or on some other machine on
 * the network.
 *
 * In terms of types, normally asynchronous processes are represented as:
 * {{{
 *   (A => Unit) => Unit
 * }}}
 *
 * This signature can be recognized in the "Observer pattern" described
 * in the "Gang of Four", although it should be noted that without
 * an `onComplete` event (like in Rx Observable pattern) you can't
 * detect completion in case this callback can be called zero or
 * multiple times.
 *
 * Some abstractions allow for signaling an error condition
 * (e.g. `MonadError` data types), so this would be a signature
 * that's closer to Scala's `Future#onComplete`:
 * {{{
 *   (Either[Throwable, A] => Unit) => Unit
 * }}}
 *
 * And many times the abstractions built to deal with asynchronous tasks
 * also provide a way to cancel such processes, to be used in race
 * conditions in order to cleanup resources early:
 * {{{
 *   (A => Unit) => Cancelable
 * }}}
 *
 * This is approximately the signature of JavaScript's `setTimeout`,
 * which will return a "task ID" that can be used to cancel it.
 *
 * ==Async Type-class==
 *
 * This type-class allows the modeling of data types that:
 *
 *  1. can start asynchronous processes
 *  2. emit exactly one result on completion
 *  3. can end in error
 *  4. are optionally cancellable
 *
 * Therefore the signature exposed by the
 * [[Async!.cancelable cancelable]] builder is this:
 * {{{
 *   (Either[Throwable, A] => Unit) => F[Unit]
 * }}}
 *
 * `F[Unit]` is used to represent a cancellation action which
 * will send a signal to the producer, that may observe it and
 * cancel the asynchronous process.
 *
 * But it can also model simple asynchronous processes that
 * cannot be cancelled, via the [[Async!.async async]] builder:
 * {{{
 *   (Either[Throwable, A] => Unit) => Unit
 * }}}
 *
 * The ability to cancel the async process is optional. For
 * `F` data types that cannot be cancelled, the `cancelable`
 * builder should be equivalent to this:
 * 
 * {{{
 *   Async[F].cancelable { cb =>
 *     k(cb)
 *     IO.unit
 *   }
 * }}}

   * This builder accepts a registration function that is

   * The registration function is also supposed to return
