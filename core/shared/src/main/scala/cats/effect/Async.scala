/**
 * A monad that can describe asynchronous or synchronous computations
 * that produce exactly one result.
 *
 * ==On Asynchrony==
 *
 * An asynchronous task represents logic that executes independent of
 * the main program flow, or current callstack. It can be a task whose
 * result gets computed on another thread, or on some other machine on
 * the network.
 *
 * In terms of types, normally asynchronous processes are represented as:
 * {{{
 *   (A => Unit) => Unit
 * }}}
 *
 * This signature can be recognized in the "Observer pattern" described
 * in the "Gang of Four", although it should be noted that without
 * an `onComplete` event (like in the Rx Observable pattern) you can't
 * detect completion in case this callback can be called zero or
 * multiple times.
 *
 * Some abstractions allow for signaling an error condition
 * (e.g. `MonadError` data types), so this would be a signature
 * that's closer to Scala's `Future#onComplete`:
 *
 * {{{
 *   (Either[Throwable, A] => Unit) => Unit
 * }}}
 *
 * And many times the abstractions built to deal with asynchronous tasks
 * also provide a way to cancel such processes, to be used in race
 * conditions in order to cleanup resources early:
 *
 * {{{
 *   (A => Unit) => Cancelable
 * }}}
 *
 * This is approximately the signature of JavaScript's `setTimeout`,
 * which will return a "task ID" that can be used to cancel it.
 *
 * N.B. this type class in particular is NOT describing cancelable
 * async processes, see the [[Concurrent]] type class for that.
 *
 * ==Async Type class==
 *
 * This type class allows the modeling of data types that:
 *
 *  1. can start asynchronous processes
 *  1. can emit one result on completion
 *  1. can end in error
 *
 * N.B. on the "one result" signaling, this is not an ''exactly once''
 * requirement. At this point streaming types can implement `Async`
 * and such an ''exactly once'' requirement is only clear in [[Effect]].
 *
 * Therefore the signature exposed by the [[Async!.async async]]
 * builder is this:
 *
 * {{{
 *   (Either[Throwable, A] => Unit) => Unit
 * }}}
 *
 * N.B. such asynchronous processes are not cancelable.
 * See the [[Concurrent]] alternative for that.

  /**
   * Creates a simple, non-cancelable `F[A]` instance that
   * executes an asynchronous process on evaluation.
   *
   * The given function is being injected with a side-effectful
   * callback for signaling the final result of an asynchronous
   * process. And its returned result needs to be a pure `F[Unit]`
   * that gets evaluated by the runtime.
   *
   * Note the simpler async variant [[async]] can be derived like this:
   *
   * {{{
   *   F.async(k) <-> F.asyncF(cb => F.delay(k(cb)))

   *
   * For wrapping impure APIs usually you can use the simpler [[async]],
   * however `asyncF` is useful in cases where impure APIs are
   * wrapped with the help of pure abstractions, such as
   * [[cats.effect.concurrent.Ref Ref]].
   *
   * For example here's how a simple, "pure Promise" implementation
   * could be implemented via `Ref` (sample is for didactic purposes,
   * as you have a far better
   * [[cats.effect.concurrent.Deferred Deferred]] available):
   *
   * {{{
   *   import cats.effect.concurrent.Ref
   *
   *   type Callback[-A] = Either[Throwable, A] => Unit
   *
   *   class PurePromise[F[_], A](ref: Ref[F, Either[List[Callback[A]], A]])
   *     (implicit F: Async[F]) {
   *
   *     def get: F[A] = F.asyncF { cb =>
   *       ref.modify {
   *         case current @ Right(result) =>
   *           (current, F.delay(cb(Right(result))))
   *         case Left(list) =>
   *           (Left(cb :: list), F.unit)
   *       }
   *     }
   *
   *     def complete(value: A): F[Unit] =
   *       F.flatten(ref.modify {
   *         case Left(list) =>
   *           (Right(value), F.delay(list.foreach(_(Right(value)))))
   *         case right =>
   *           (right, F.unit)
   *       })
   *   }
   * }}}
   *
   * N.B. if `F[_]` is a cancelable data type (i.e. implementing
   * [[Concurrent]]), then the returned `F[Unit]` can be cancelable,
   * its evaluation hooking into the underlying cancelation mechanism
   * of `F[_]`, so something like this behaves like you'd expect:
   *
   * {{{
   *   def delayed[F[_], A](thunk: => A)
   *     (implicit F: Async[F], timer: Timer[F]): F[A] = {
   *
   *     timer.sleep(1.second) *> F.delay(cb(
   *       try cb(Right(thunk))
   *       catch { case NonFatal(e) => Left(cb(Left(e))) }
   *     ))
   *   }
   * }}}
   *
   * The `asyncF` operation behaves like [[Sync.suspend]], except
   * that the result has to be signaled via the provided callback.
   *
   * ==ERROR HANDLING==
   *
   * As a matter of contract the returned `F[Unit]` should not
   * throw errors. If it does, then the behavior is undefined.
   *
   * This is because by contract the provided callback should
   * only be called once. Calling it concurrently, multiple times,
   * is a contract violation. And if the returned `F[Unit]` throws,
   * then the implementation might have called it already, so it
   * would be a contract violation to call it without expensive
   * synchronization.
   *
   * In case errors are thrown the behavior is implementation specific.
   * The error might get logged to stderr, or via other mechanisms
   * that are implementations specific.
   *
   * @see [[async]] for the simpler variant.
   *
   * @param k is a function that should be called with a
   *       callback for signaling the result once it is ready
