/**
 * The `Resource` is a data structure that captures the effectful
 * allocation of a resource, along with its finalizer.
 *
 * This can be used to wrap expensive resources. Example:
 *
 * {{{
 *   def open(file: File): Resource[IO, BufferedReader] =
 *     Resource(IO {
 *       val in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file))
 *       (in, IO(in.close()))
 *     })
 * }}}
 *
 * Usage is done via [[Resource!.use use]] and note that resource usage nests,
 * because its implementation is specified in terms of [[Bracket]]:
 *
 * {{{
 *   open(file1).use { in1 =>
 *     open(file2).use { in2 =>
 *       readFiles(in1, in2)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * `Resource` forms a `MonadError` on the resource type when the
 * effect type has a `cats.MonadError` instance. Nested resources are
 * released in reverse order of acquisition. Outer resources are
 * released even if an inner use or release fails.
 *
 * {{{
 *   def mkResource(s: String) = {
 *     val acquire = IO(println(s"Acquiring $s")) *> IO.pure(s)
 *     def release(s: String) = IO(println(s"Releasing $s"))
 *     Resource.make(acquire)(release)
 *   }
 *
 *   val r = for {
 *     outer <- mkResource("outer")
 *     inner <- mkResource("inner")
 *   } yield (outer, inner)
 *
 *   r.use { case (a, b) =>
 *     IO(println(s"Using $a and $b"))
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * On evaluation the above prints:
 * {{{
 *   Acquiring outer
 *   Acquiring inner
 *   Using outer and inner
 *   Releasing inner
 *   Releasing outer
 * }}}
 *
 * A `Resource` is nothing more than a data structure, an ADT, described by
 * the following node types and that can be interpretted if needed:
 *
 *  - [[cats.effect.Resource.Allocate Allocate]]
 *  - [[cats.effect.Resource.Suspend Suspend]]
 *  - [[cats.effect.Resource.Bind Bind]]
 *
 * Normally users don't need to care about these node types, unless conversions
 * from `Resource` into something else is needed (e.g. conversion from `Resource`
 * into a streaming data type).
 *
 * @tparam F the effect type in which the resource is allocated and released
 * @tparam A the type of resource
