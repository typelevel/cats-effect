/**
 * A convenience trait for defining applications which are entirely within [[Resource]]. This is
 * implemented as a relatively straightforward wrapper around [[IOApp]] and thus inherits most
 * of its functionality and semantics.
 *
 * This trait should generally be used for any application which would otherwise trivially end
 * with [[cats.effect.kernel.Resource!.use]] (or one of its variants). For example:
 *
 * {{{
 *   object HttpExample extends IOApp {
 *     def run(args: List[String]) = {
 *       val program = for {
 *         config <- Resource.eval(loadConfig(args.head))
 *         postgres <- Postgres[IO](config.jdbcUri)
 *         endpoints <- ExampleEndpoints[IO](config, postgres)
 *         _ <- HttpServer[IO](config.host, config.port, endpoints)
 *       } yield ()
 *
 *       program.useForever.as(ExitCode.Success)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * This example assumes some underlying libraries like
 * [[https://tpolecat.github.io/skunk/ Skunk]] and [[https://http4s.org Http4s]], but otherwise
 * it represents a relatively typical example of what the main class for a realistic Cats Effect
 * application might look like. Notably, the whole thing is enclosed in `Resource`, which is
 * `use`d at the very end. This kind of pattern is so common that `ResourceApp` defines a
 * special trait which represents it. We can rewrite the above example:
 *
 * {{{
 *   object HttpExample extends ResourceApp.Forever {
 *     def run(args: List[String]) =
 *       for {
 *         config <- Resource.eval(loadConfig(args.head))
 *         db <- Postgres[IO](config.jdbcUri)
 *         endpoints <- ExampleEndpoints[IO](config, db)
 *         _ <- HttpServer[IO](config.host, config.port, endpoints)
 *       } yield ()
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * These two programs are equivalent.

 *   [[run]]
 * @see
 *   [[ResourceApp.Simple]]
