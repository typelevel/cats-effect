/**
 * INTERNAL API â€” Newtype encoding, used for defining `IO.Par`.
 *
 * The `IONewtype` abstract class indirection is needed for Scala 2.10,
 * otherwise we could just define these types straight on the
 * `IO.Par` companion object. In Scala 2.10 defining these types
 * straight on the companion object yields an error like
 * ''"only classes can have declared but undefined members"''.
