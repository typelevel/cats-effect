/**
 * `Fiber` represents the (pure) result of an [[Async]] data type (e.g. [[IO]])
 * being started concurrently and that can be either joined or canceled.
 *
 * You can think of fibers as being lightweight threads, a fiber being a
 * concurrency primitive for doing cooperative multi-tasking.
 *
 * For example a `Fiber` value is the result of evaluating [[IO.start]]:
 *
 * {{{
 *   val io = IO.shift *> IO(println("Hello!"))
 *
 *   val fiber: IO[Fiber[IO, Unit]] = io.start
 * }}}
 *
 * Usage example:
 *
 * {{{
 *   for {
 *     fiber <- IO.shift *> launchMissiles.start
 *     _ <- runToBunker.handleErrorWith { error =>
 *       // Retreat failed, cancel launch (maybe we should
 *       // have retreated to our bunker before the launch?)
 *       fiber.cancel *> IO.raiseError(error)
 *     }
 *     aftermath <- fiber.join
 *   } yield {
 *     aftermath
 *   }
 * }}}
