/**
 * `App` type that runs a [[cats.effect.IO]].  Shutdown occurs after
 * the `IO` completes, as follows:
 *
 * - If completed with `ExitCode.Success`, the main method exits and
 *   shutdown is handled by the platform.
 *
 * - If completed with any other [[ExitCode]], `sys.exit` is called
 *   with the specified code.
 *
 * - If the `IO` raises an error, the stack trace is printed to
 *   standard error and `sys.exit(1)` is called.
 *
 * When a shutdown is requested via a signal, the `IO` is canceled and
 * we wait for the `IO` to release any resources.  The process exits
 * with the numeric value of the signal plus 128.
