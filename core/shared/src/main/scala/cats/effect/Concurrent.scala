/**
 * Type class for [[Async]] data types that are cancelable and
 * can be started concurrently.
 *
 * Thus this type class allows abstracting over data types that:
 *
 *  1. implement the [[Async]] algebra, with all its restrictions
 *  1. can provide logic for cancellation, to be used in race
 *     conditions in order to release resources early
 *     (in its [[Concurrent!.cancelable cancelable]] builder)
 *
 * Due to these restrictions, this type class also affords to describe
 * a [[Concurrent!.start start]] operation that can start async
 * processes, suspended in the context of `F[_]` and that can be
 * canceled or joined.
 *
 * Without cancellation being baked in, we couldn't afford to do it.
 * See below.
 *
 * ==Cancelable builder==
 *
 * The signature exposed by the [[Concurrent!.cancelable cancelable]]
 * builder is this:
 *
 * {{{
 *   (Either[Throwable, A] => Unit) => CancelToken[F]
 * }}}
 *
 * [[CancelToken CancelToken[F]]] is just an alias for `F[Unit]` and
 * used to represent a cancellation action which will send a signal
 * to the producer, that may observe it and cancel the asynchronous
 * process.
 *
 * ==On Cancellation==
 *
 * Simple asynchronous processes, like Scala's `Future`, can be
 * described with this very basic and side-effectful type and you
 * should recognize what is more or less the signature of
 * `Future#onComplete` or of [[Async.async]] (minus the error
 * handling):
 *
 * {{{
 *   (A => Unit) => Unit
 * }}}
 *
 * But many times the abstractions built to deal with asynchronous
 * tasks can also provide a way to cancel such processes, to be used
 * in race conditions in order to cleanup resources early, so a very
 * basic and side-effectful definition of asynchronous processes that
 * can be canceled would be:
 *
 * {{{
 *   (A => Unit) => CancelToken
 * }}}
 *
 * This is approximately the signature of JavaScript's `setTimeout`,
 * which will return a "task ID" that can be used to cancel it. Or of
 * Java's `ScheduledExecutorService#schedule`, which will return a
 * Java `ScheduledFuture` that has a `.cancel()` operation on it.
 *
 * Similarly, for `Concurrent` data types, we can provide
 * cancellation logic that can be triggered in race conditions to
 * cancel the on-going processing, only that `Concurrent`'s
 * cancelation token is an action suspended in an `F[Unit]`.
 *
 * Suppose you want to describe a "sleep" operation, like that described
 * by [[Timer]] to mirror Java's `ScheduledExecutorService.schedule`
 * or JavaScript's `setTimeout`:
 *
 * {{{
 *   def sleep(d: FiniteDuration): F[Unit]
 * }}}
 *
 * This signature is in fact incomplete for data types that are not
 * cancelable, because such equivalent operations always return some
 * cancellation token that can be used to trigger a forceful
 * interruption of the timer. This is not a normal "dispose" or
 * "finally" clause in a try/catch block, because "cancel" in the
 * context of an asynchronous process is ''concurrent'' with the
 * task's own run-loop.
 *
 * To understand what this means, consider that in the case of our
 * `sleep` as described above, on cancellation we'd need a way to
 * signal to the underlying `ScheduledExecutorService` to forcefully
 * remove the scheduled `Runnable` from its internal queue of
 * scheduled tasks, ''before'' its execution. Therefore, without a
 * cancelable data type, a safe signature needs to return a
 * cancellation token, so it would look like this:
 *
 * {{{
 *   def sleep(d: FiniteDuration): F[(F[Unit], F[Unit])]
 * }}}
 *
 * This function is returning a tuple, with one `F[Unit]` to wait for
 * the completion of our sleep and a second `F[Unit]` to cancel the
 * scheduled computation in case we need it. This is in fact the shape
 * of [[Fiber]]'s API. And this is exactly what the
 * [[Concurrent!.start start]] operation returns.
 *
 * The difference between a [[Concurrent]] data type and one that
 * is only [[Async]] is that you can go from any `F[A]` to a
 * `F[Fiber[F, A]]`, to participate in race conditions and that can be
 * canceled should the need arise, in order to trigger an early
 * release of allocated resources.
 *
 * Thus a [[Concurrent]] data type can safely participate in race
 * conditions, whereas a data type that is only [[Async]] cannot do it
 * without exposing and forcing the user to work with cancellation
 * tokens. An [[Async]] data type cannot expose for example a `start`
 * operation that is safe.
 *
 * == Resource-safety ==
 *
 * [[Concurrent]] data types are required to cooperate with [[Bracket]].
 * `Concurrent` being cancelable by law, what this means for the
 * corresponding `Bracket` is that cancelation can be observed and
 * that in the case of [[Bracket.bracketCase bracketCase]] the
 * [[ExitCase.Canceled]] branch will get executed on cancelation.
 *
 * By default the `cancelable` builder is derived from `bracketCase`
 * and from [[Async.asyncF asyncF]], so what this means is that
 * whatever you can express with `cancelable`, you can also express
 * with `bracketCase`.
 *
 * For [[Bracket.uncancelable uncancelable]], the [[Fiber.cancel cancel]]
 * signal has no effect on the result of [[Fiber.join join]] and
 * the cancelable token returned by [[ConcurrentEffect.runCancelable]]
 * on evaluation will have no effect if evaluated.
 *
 * So `uncancelable` must undo the cancellation mechanism of
 * [[Concurrent!.cancelable cancelable]], with this equivalence:
 *
 * {{{
 *   F.uncancelable(F.cancelable { cb => f(cb); token }) <-> F.async(f)
 * }}}
 *
 * Sample:
 *
 * {{{
 *   val F = Concurrent[IO]
 *   val timer = Timer[IO]
 *
 *   // Normally Timer#sleep yields cancelable tasks
 *   val tick = F.uncancelable(timer.sleep(10.seconds))
 *
 *   // This prints "Tick!" after 10 seconds, even if we are
 *   // canceling the Fiber after start:
 *   for {
 *     fiber <- F.start(tick)
 *     _ <- fiber.cancel
 *     _ <- fiber.join
 *     _ <- F.delay { println("Tick!") }
 *   } yield ()
 * }}}
 *
 * When doing [[Bracket.bracket bracket]] or [[Bracket.bracketCase bracketCase]],
 * `acquire` and `release` operations are guaranteed to be uncancelable as well.
