/**
  * A purely functional synchronization primitive which represents a single value
  * which may not yet be available.
  *
  * When created, a `Deferred` is empty. It can then be completed exactly once,
  * and never be made empty again.
  *
  * `get` on an empty `Deferred` will block until the `Deferred` is completed.
  * `get` on a completed `Deferred` will always immediately return its content.
  *
  * `complete(a)` on an empty `Deferred` will set it to `a`, and notify any and
  * all readers currently blocked on a call to `get`.
  * `complete(a)` on a `Deferred` that has already been completed will not modify
  * its content, and result in a failed `F`.
  *
  * Albeit simple, `Deferred` can be used in conjunction with [[Ref]] to build
  * complex concurrent behaviour and data structures like queues and semaphores.
  *
  * Finally, the blocking mentioned above is semantic only, no actual threads are
  * blocked by the implementation.

    * use `F.start(Async.shift *> r.complete)` if you want asynchronous behaviour.

    * If this `Deferred` has already been completed, the returned action immediately fails with
