  /**
   * A cancelation token is an effectful action that is
   * able to cancel a running task.
   *
   * This is just an alias in order to clarify the API.
   * For example seeing `CancelToken[IO]` instead of `IO[Unit]`
   * can be more readable.
   *
   * Cancelation tokens usually have these properties:
   *
   *  1. they suspend over side effectful actions on shared state
   *  1. they need to be idempotent
   *
   * Note that in the case of well behaved implementations like
   * that of [[IO]] idempotency is taken care of by its internals
   * whenever dealing with cancellation tokens, but idempotency
   * is a useful property to keep in mind when building such values.
