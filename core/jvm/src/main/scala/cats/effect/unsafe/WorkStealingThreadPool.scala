/**
 * Work-stealing thread pool which manages a pool of [[WorkerThread]] s for the specific purpose
 * of executing [[java.lang.Runnable]] instancess with work-stealing scheduling semantics.
 *
 * The thread pool starts with `threadCount` worker threads in the active state, looking to find
 * fibers to execute in their own local work stealing queues, or externally scheduled work
 * coming from the external queue.
 *
 * In the case that a worker thread cannot find work to execute in its own queue, or the
 * external queue, it asks for permission from the pool to enter the searching state, which
 * allows that thread to try and steal work from the other worker threads. The pool tries to
 * maintain at most `threadCount / 2` worker threads which are searching for work, to reduce
 * contention. Work stealing is tried using a linear search starting from a random worker thread
 * index.
