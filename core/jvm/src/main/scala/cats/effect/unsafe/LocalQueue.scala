import java.util.ArrayList
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue

/**
 * Fixed length, FIFO, single producer, multiple consumer, lock-free, circular
 * buffer queue local to a single [[WorkerThread]].
 *
 * The queue supports exclusive write access '''only''' by the owner
 * [[WorkerThread]] to the `tail`, which represents the pointer for updating the
 * underlying `buffer` of [[cats.effect.IOFiber]] object references.
 *
 * The queue supports multi-threaded reading from the `head` pointer, both for
 * local dequeue operations by the owner [[WorkerThread]], as well as for work
 * stealing purposes by other contending [[WorkerThread]]s.
 *
 * The synchronization is achieved through atomic operations on
 * [[java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger]] (used for representing the
 * `head` and the `tail` pointers).
 *
 * The code makes heavy use of the
 * [[java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger#lazySet]] atomic operation to
 * achieve relaxed memory ordering guarantees when compared to a JVM `volatile`
 * variable.
 *
 * General implementation details and notes:
 *
 *   1. Loads with ''plain'' memory semantics are all direct accesses of
 *      non-volatile fields. These loads have absolutely no memory
 *      synchronization effects on their own, and the JIT compiler is completely
 *      free to instruct the CPU to reorder them for optimization purposes,
 *      cache the value or outright decide not to load them again. Therefore,
 *      these loads are '''not''' suitable for multi-threaded code. For more
 *      details, please consult the section explaining ''plain'' mode in the
 *      following amazing resource on the
 *      [[http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/j9mm.html#plainsec Java 9+ memory model]].
 *
 *      The `tail` of the queue is loaded with ''plain'' memory semantics
 *      whenever it is accessed by the owner [[WorkerThread]], since it is the
 *      only thread that is allowed to update the field, and therefore always
 *      has the most recent value, making memory synchronization unnecessary.
 *
 *      ''Plain'' loads of `volatile` or
 *      [[java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger]] are unfortunately
 *      unavailable on Java 8. These however are simulated with a specialized
 *      subclass of [[java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger]] which
 *      additionally keeps a non-volatile field which the owner [[WorkerThread]]
 *      reads in order to avoid ''acquire'' memory barriers which are
 *      unavoidable when reading a `volatile` field or using
 *      [[java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger#get]].
 *
 *   2. Loads with ''acquire'' memory semantics are achieved on the JVM either
 *      by a direct load of a `volatile` field or by using
 *      [[java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger#get]].
 *
 *      The `head` of the queue is '''always''' loaded using ''acquire'' memory
 *      semantics and stored using compare-and-swap operations which provide
 *      (among other properties) ''release'' memory semantics, the synchronizing
 *      counterpart which ensures proper publishing of memory location changes
 *      between threads.
 *
 *      The `tail` of the queue is loaded using ''acquire'' memory semantics
 *      whenever it is accessed from another [[WorkerThread]]. That way, the
 *      most recently published value of the tail is obtained and can be used to
 *      calculate the number of fibers available for stealing.
 *
 *      For more details, please consult the section explaining
 *      ''acquire/release'' mode in the following amazing resource on the
 *      [[http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/j9mm.html#plainsec Java 9+ memory model]].
 *
 *   3. Stores with ''release'' memory semantics are achieved on the JVM using
 *      the [[java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger#lazySet]] operation.
 *      Prior to Java 9, this is a unique, underdocumented and often
 *      misunderstood operation. It is a `volatile` write without a full memory
 *      fence, allowing for much higher throughput under heavy contention,
 *      provided that it is used in a single producer environment, such as this
 *      queue. The value of the `tail` published using ''release'' semantics can
 *      be properly detected by other threads using loads with ''acquire''
 *      memory semantics, which is always the case whenever non-owner
 *      [[WorkerThread]]s load the value of the tail of another
 *      [[WorkerThread]]'s local queue. All of the credit for this invaluable
 *      discovery goes to Nitsan Wakart and their phenomenal
 *      [[http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.com/2012/12/atomiclazyset-is-performance-win-for.html blog post]].
 *
 *      The post also contains more details on the fascinating history of
 *      [[java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger#lazySet]], with comments and
 *      quotes from Doug Lea.
 *
 *   4. Even though usage of `sun.misc.Unsafe` in these classes was heavily
 *      experimented with, it was decided to ultimately settle on standard Java
 *      APIs. We believe that being a good JVM citizen (using official APIs),
 *      making it easier for users to create GraalVM native images and having
 *      generally more maintainable code vastly outweigh the marginal
 *      improvements to performance that `Unsafe` would bring. The inherent
 *      contention that arises under thread synchronization in the
 *      multi-threaded cats-effect runtime is still much more costly such that
 *      the performance gains with `Unsafe` pale in comparison. We have found
 *      that algorithm improvements and smarter data structures bring much
 *      larger performance gains.
 *
 *      Should a discovery be made which proves that direct usage of `Unsafe`
 *      brings dramatic improvements in performance, this decision to not use it
 *      might be reversed. This is however, very unlikely, as
 *      [[java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger]] is just a thin wrapper
 *      around `Unsafe`. And `Unsafe` is only really needed on JVM 8. JVM 9+
 *      introduce much richer and better APIs and tools for building
 *      high-performance concurrent systems (e.g. `VarHandle`).
