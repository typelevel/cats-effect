     *
     *   0: To increase the fairness towards fibers scheduled by threads which
     *      are external to the `WorkStealingThreadPool`, every
     *      `ExternalQueueTicks` number of iterations, the external queue takes
     *      precedence over the local queue.
     *
     *      If a fiber is successfully dequeued from the external queue, it will
     *      be executed immediately. If a batch of fibers is dequeued instead,
     *      the whole batch is enqueued on the local queue and other worker
     *      threads are notified of existing work available for stealing. The
     *      `WorkerThread` unconditionally transitions to executing fibers from
     *      the local queue (state value 4 and larger).
     *
     *      This state occurs "naturally" after a certain number of executions
     *      from the local queue (when the state value wraps around modulo
     *      `ExternalQueueTicks`).
     *
     *   1: Fall back to checking the external queue after a failed dequeue from
     *      the local queue. Depending on the outcome of this check, the
     *      `WorkerThread` transitions to executing fibers from the local queue
     *      in the case of a successful dequeue from the external queue (state
     *      value 4 and larger). Otherwise, the `WorkerThread` continues with
     *      asking for permission to steal from other `WorkerThread`s.
     *
     *      Depending on the outcome of this request, the `WorkerThread` starts
     *      looking for fibers to steal from the local queues of other worker
     *      threads (if permission was granted, state value 2), or parks
     *      directly. In this case, there is less bookkeeping to be done
     *      compared to the case where a worker was searching for work prior to
     *      parking. After the worker thread has been unparked, it transitions
     *      to looking for work in the external queue (state value 3) while also
     *      holding a permission to steal fibers from other worker threads.
     *
     *   2: The `WorkerThread` has been allowed to steal fibers from other
     *      worker threads. If the attempt is successful, the first fiber is
     *      executed directly and the `WorkerThread` transitions to executing
     *      fibers from the local queue (state value 4 and larger). If the
     *      attempt is unsuccessful, the worker thread announces to the pool
     *      that it was unable to find any work and parks.
     *
     *   3: The `WorkerThread` has been unparked an is looking for work in the
     *      external queue. If it manages to find work there, it announces to
     *      the work stealing thread pool that it is no longer searching for
     *      work and continues to execute fibers from the local queue (state
     *      value 4 and larger). Otherwise, it transitions to searching for work
     *      to steal from the local queues of other worker threads because the
     *      permission to steal is implicitly held by threads that have been
     *      unparked (state value 2).
     *
     *   4 and larger: Look for fibers to execute in the local queue. In case
     *      of a successful dequeue from the local queue, increment the state
     *      value. In case of a failed dequeue from the local queue, transition
     *      to looking for fibers in the external queue (state value 1).
     *
     * A note on the implementation. Some of the states seem like they have
     * overlapping logic. This is indeed true, but it is a conscious decision.
     * The logic is carefully unrolled and compiled into a shallow `tableswitch`
     * instead of a deeply nested sequence of `if/else` statements. This change
     * has lead to a non-negligible 15-20% increase in single-threaded
     * performance.
