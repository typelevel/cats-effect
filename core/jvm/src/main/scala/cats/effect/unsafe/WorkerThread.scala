     * semantics explained here:
     *
     *   0: To increase the fairness towards fibers scheduled by threads which
     *      are external to the `WorkStealingThreadPool`, every
     *      `OverflowQueueTicks` number of iterations, the overflow queue takes
     *      precedence over the local queue.
     *
     *      If a fiber is successfully dequeued from the overflow queue, it will
     *      be executed. The `WorkerThread` unconditionally transitions to
     *      executing fibers from the local queue (state value 7 and larger).
     *
     *      This state occurs "naturally" after a certain number of executions
     *      from the local queue (when the state value wraps around modulo
     *      `OverflowQueueTicks`).
     *
     *   1: Fall back to checking the batched queue after a failed dequeue from
     *      the local queue. Depending on the outcome of this check, the
     *      `WorkerThread` transitions to executing fibers from the local queue
     *      in the case of a successful dequeue from the batched queue and
     *      subsequent bulk enqueue of the batch to the local queue (state value
     *      7 and larger). Otherwise, the `WorkerThread` transitions to looking
     *      for single fibers in the overflow queue.
     *
     *   2: Fall back to checking the overflow queue after a failed dequeue from
     *      the local queue. Depending on the outcome of this check, the
     *      `WorkerThread` transitions to executing fibers from the local queue
     *      in the case of a successful dequeue from the overflow queue
     *      (state value 7 and larger). Otherwise, the `WorkerThread`
     *      transitions to asking for permission to steal from other
     *      `WorkerThread`s (state value 3).
     *
     *   3: Ask for permission to steal fibers from other `WorkerThread`s.
     *      Depending on the outcome, the `WorkerThread` transitions starts
     *      looking for fibers to steal from the local queues of other
     *      worker threads (permission granted, state value 4), or parks
     *      directly. In this case, there is less bookkeeping to be done
     *      compared to the case where a worker was searching for work prior
     *      to parking. After the worker thread has been unparked, it
     *      transitions to looking for work in the batched (state value 5) and
     *      overflow queues (state value 6) while also holding a permission to
     *      steal fibers from other worker threads.
     *
     *   4: The `WorkerThread` has been allowed to steal fibers from other
     *      worker threads. If the attempt is successful, the first fiber is
     *      executed directly and the `WorkerThread` transitions to executing
     *      fibers from the local queue (state value 7 and larger). If the
     *      attempt is unsuccessful, the worker thread announces to the pool
     *      that it was unable to find any work and parks. After the worker
     *      thread has been unparked, it transitions to looking for work in the
     *      batched (state value 5) and overflow queues (state value 6) while
     *      also holding a permission to steal fibers from other worker threads.
     *
     *   5: State after a worker thread has been unparked. In this state, the
     *      permission to steal from other worker threads is implicitly held.
     *      The unparked worker thread starts by looking for work in the
     *      batched queue. If a fiber has been found, it is executed and the
     *      worker thread transitions to executing fibers from the local queue
     *      (state value 7 and larger). If no fiber has been found, the worker
     *      thread proceeds to look for single fibers in the overflow queue
     *      (state value 6).
     *
     *   6: In this state, the permission to steal from other worker threads is
     *      implicitly held. If a fiber has been found in the overflow queue, it
     *      is executed and the worker thread transitions to executing fibers
     *      from the local queue (state value 7 and larger). If no fiber has
     *      been found, the worker thread proceeds to steal work from other
     *      worker threads (since it already has the permission to do so by
     *      convention) (state value 4).
     *
     *   7 and larger: Look for fibers to execute in the local queue. In case
     *      of a successful dequeue from the local queue, increment the state
     *      value. In case of a failed dequeue from the local queue, transition
     *      to looking for fibers in the batched queue (state value 1).
     *
     * A note on the implementation. Some of the states seem like they have
     * overlapping logic. This is indeed true, but it is a conscious decision.
     * The logic is carefully unrolled and compiled into a shallow `tableswitch`
     * instead of a deeply nested sequence of `if/else` statements. This change
     * has lead to a non-negligible 15-20% increase in single-threaded
     * performance.
