/**
 * A specialized heap that serves as a priority queue for timers i.e. callbacks with trigger
 * times.
 *
 * In general, this heap is not threadsafe and modifications (insertion/removal) may only be
 * performed on its owner WorkerThread. The exception is that the callback value of nodes may be
 * `null`ed by other threads and published via data race.
 *
 * Other threads may traverse the heap with the `steal` method during which they may `null` some
 * callbacks. This is entirely subject to data races.
 *
 * The only explicit synchronization is the `canceledCounter` atomic, which is used to track and
 * publish cancelations from other threads. Because other threads cannot safely remove a node,
 * they `null` the callback, toggle the `canceled` flag, and increment the counter to indicate
 * that the owner thread should iterate the heap to remove these nodes a.k.a. "packing".
 *
 * To amortize the cost of packing, we only do so if canceled nodes make up at least half of the
 * heap. In an ideal world, cancelation from external threads is relatively rare and those nodes
 * are removed naturally as they surface to the top of the heap, such that we never exceed the
 * packing threshold.
