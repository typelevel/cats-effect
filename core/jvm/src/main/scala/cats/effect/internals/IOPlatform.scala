  /**
   * Establishes the maximum stack depth for `IO#map` operations.
   *
   * The default is `128`, from which we substract one as an
   * optimization. This default has been reached like this:
   *
   *  - according to official docs, the default stack size on 32-bits
   *    Windows and Linux was 320 KB, whereas for 64-bits it is 1024 KB
   *  - according to measurements chaining `Function1` references uses
   *    approximately 32 bytes of stack space on a 64 bits system;
   *    this could be lower if "compressed oops" is activated
   *  - therefore a "map fusion" that goes 128 in stack depth can use
   *    about 4 KB of stack space
   *
   * If this parameter becomes a problem, it can be tuned by setting
   * the `cats.effect.fusionMaxStackDepth` environment variable when
   * executing the Java VM:
   *
   * <pre>
   *   java -Dcats.effect.fusionMaxStackDepth=32 \
   *        ...
   * </pre>
