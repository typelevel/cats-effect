   * It is intended that `bound` be tracked externally and incremented on each clear(). Whenever
   * pack is called, the number of empty cells removed from the stack is produced. It is
   * expected that this value should be subtracted from `bound` for the subsequent pack/clear
   * calls. It is permissible to pack on every clear() for simplicity, though it may be more
   * reasonable to delay pack() calls until bound exceeds some reasonable threshold.
   *
   * The observation here is that it is cheapest to remove empty cells from the front of the
   * list, but very expensive to remove them from the back of the list, and so we can be
   * relatively aggressive about the former and conservative about the latter. In a "pack on
   * every clear" protocol, the best possible case is if we're always clearing at the very front
   * of the list. In this scenario, pack is always O(1). Conversely, the worst possible scenario
   * is when we're clearing at the *end* of the list. In this case, we won't actually remove any
   * cells until exactly half the list is emptied (thus, the number of empty cells is equal to
   * the number of full cells). In this case, the final pack is O(n), while the accumulated
   * wasted packs (which will fail to remove any items) will total to O((n / 2)^2). Thus, in the
   * worst case, we would need O((n / 2)^2 + n) operations to clear out the waste, where the
   * waste would be accumulated by n / 2 total clears, meaning that the marginal cost added to
   * clear is O(n/2 + 2), which is to say, O(n).
   *
   * In order to reduce this to a sub-linear cost, we need to pack less frequently, with higher
   * bounds, as the number of outstanding clears increases. Thus, rather than packing on each
   * clear, we should pack on the even log clears (1, 2, 4, 8, etc). For cases where most of the
   * churn is at the head of the list, this remains essentially O(1) and clears frequently. For
   * cases where the churn is buried deeper in the list, it becomes O(log n) per clear
   * (amortized). This still biases the optimizations towards the head of the list, but ensures
   * that packing will still inevitably reach all of the garbage cells.
