/**
 * Represents a stateful system for managing and interacting with a polling system. Polling
 * systems are typically used in scenarios such as handling multiplexed blocking I/O or other
 * event-driven systems, where one needs to repeatedly check (or "poll") some condition or
 * state, blocking up to some timeout until it is ready.
 *
 * This class abstracts the general components and actions of a polling system, such as:
 *   - The user-facing interface (API) which interacts with the outside world
 *   - The thread-local data structure used for polling, which keeps track of the internal state
 *     of the system and its events
 *   - The lifecycle management methods, such as creating and closing the polling system and its
 *     components
 *   - The runtime interaction methods, such as polling events and interrupting the process
