/**
 * A slightly more involved implementation of an unordered bag used for tracking asynchronously
 * suspended fiber instances on the JVM. This bag is backed by an array of synchronized
 * `java.util.WeakHashMap` instances. This decision is based on several factors:
 *   1. A `java.util.WeakHashMap` is used because we want the resumed fibers to be automatically
 *      removed from the hash map data structure by the GC, whenever their keys expire (which is
 *      right around their resumption).
 *   1. `java.util.WeakHashMap` is **not** thread safe by nature. In the official javadoc for
 *      this class it is recommended that an instance be wrapped in
 *      `java.util.Collections.synchronizedMap` before writing to the hash map from different
 *      threads. This is absolutely crucial in our use case, because fibers can be carried by
 *      any thread (including threads external to the compute thread pool, e.g. when using
 *      `IO#evalOn`).
 *   1. Because `java.util.Collections.synchronizedMap` is a simple wrapper around any map which
 *      just synchronizes the access to the map through the built in JVM `synchronized`
 *      mechanism, we need several instances of these synchronized `WeakHashMap`s just to reduce
 *      contention between threads. A particular instance is selected using a thread local
 *      source of randomness using an instance of `java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom`.
