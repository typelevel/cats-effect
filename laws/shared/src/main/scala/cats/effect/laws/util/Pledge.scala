/**
 * `Pledge` is a value that can be completed later, much like a
 * Scala `Promise`, but pure, to be used in describing laws that
 * require the observation of side effects.
 *
 * The internal implementation effectively wraps a Scala `Promise`,
 * so it has the same contract:
 *
 *  1. it can only be "completed" once, being a write-once value
 *  1. once written, the value is memoized for subsequent reads
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * {{{
 *   for {
 *     pledge <- Pledge[IO, Int]
 *     fiber <- pledge.await[IO].start
 *     _ <- pledge.complete[IO](100)
 *     result <- fiber.join
 *   } yield {
 *     result
 *   }
 * }}}
