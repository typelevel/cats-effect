/**
 * This construction supports `Async.cont`
 * ```
 * trait Async[F[_]] {
 * ...
 *
 * def cont[A](body: Cont[F, A]): F[A]
 * }
 * ```
 * It's a low level operation meant for implementors, end users should use `async`, `start` or
 * `Deferred` instead, depending on the use case.
 *
 * It can be understood as providing an operation to resume an `F` asynchronously, of type
 * `Either[Throwable, A] => Unit`, and an (interruptible) operation to semantically block until
 * resumption, of type `F[A]`. We will refer to the former as `resume`, and the latter as `get`.
 *
 * These two operations capture the essence of semantic blocking, and can be used to build
 * `async`, which in turn can be used to build `Fiber`, `start`, `Deferred` and so on.
 *
 * Refer to the default implementation to `Async[F].async` for an example of usage.
 *
 * The reason for the shape of the `Cont` construction in `Async[F].cont`, as opposed to simply:
 *
 * {{{
 * trait Async[F[_]] {
 *   ...
 *
 *   def cont[A]: F[(Either[Throwable, A] => Unit, F[A])]
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * is that it's not safe to use concurrent operations such as `get.start`.
 *
 * The `Cont` encoding therefore simulates higher-rank polymorphism to ensure that you can not
 * call `start` on `get`, but only use operations up to `MonadCancel` (`flatMap`, `onCancel`,
 * `uncancelable`, etc).
 *
 * If you are an implementor, and you have an implementation of `async` but not `cont`, you can
 * override `Async[F].async` with your implementation, and use `Async.defaultCont` to implement
 * `Async[F].cont`.
