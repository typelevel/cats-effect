/**
 * `Resource` is a data structure which encodes the idea of executing an action which has an
 * associated finalizer that needs to be run when the action completes.
 *
 * Examples include scarce resources like files, which need to be closed after use, or
 * concurrent abstractions like locks, which need to be released after having been acquired.
 *
 * There are several constructors to allocate a resource, the most common is
 * [[Resource.make make]]:
 *
 * {{{
 *   def open(file: File): Resource[IO, BufferedReader] = {
 *     val openFile = IO(new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file)))
 *     Resource.make(acquire = openFile)(release = f => IO(f.close))
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * and several methods to consume a resource, the most common is [[Resource!.use use]]:
 *
 * {{{
 *   def readFile(file: BufferedReader): IO[Content]
 *
 *   open(file1).use(readFile)
 * }}}
 *
 * Finalisation (in this case file closure) happens when the action passed to `use` terminates.
 * Therefore, the code above is _not_ equivalent to:
 *
 * {{{
 *   open(file1).use(IO.pure).flatMap(readFile)
 * }}}
 *
 * which will instead result in an error, since the file gets closed after `pure`, meaning that
 * `.readFile` will then fail.
 *
 * Also note that a _new_ resource is allocated every time `use` is called, so the following
 * code opens and closes the resource twice:
 *
 * {{{
 *   val file: Resource[IO, File]
 *   file.use(read) >> file.use(read)
 * }}}
 *
 * If you want sharing, pass the result of allocating the resource around, and call `use` once.
 * {{{
 *   file.use { file => read(file) >> read(file) }
 * }}}
 *
 * The acquire and release actions passed to `make` are not interruptible, and release will run
 * when the action passed to `use` succeeds, fails, or is interrupted. You can use
 * [[Resource.makeCase makeCase]] to specify a different release logic depending on each of the
 * three outcomes above.
 *
 * It is also possible to specify an interruptible acquire though [[Resource.makeFull makeFull]]
 * but be warned that this is an advanced concurrency operation, which requires some care.
 *
 * Resource usage nests:
 *
 * {{{
 *   open(file1).use { in1 =>
 *     open(file2).use { in2 =>
 *       readFiles(in1, in2)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * However, it is more idiomatic to compose multiple resources together before `use`, exploiting
 * the fact that `Resource` forms a `Monad`, and therefore that resources can be nested through
 * `flatMap`. Nested resources are released in reverse order of acquisition. Outer resources are
 * released even if an inner use or release fails.
 *
 * {{{
 *   def mkResource(s: String) = {
 *     val acquire = IO(println(s"Acquiring $$s")) *> IO.pure(s)
 *     def release(s: String) = IO(println(s"Releasing $$s"))
 *     Resource.make(acquire)(release)
 *   }
 *
 *   val r = for {
 *     outer <- mkResource("outer")
 *
 *     inner <- mkResource("inner")
 *   } yield (outer, inner)
 *
 *   r.use { case (a, b) =>
 *     IO(println(s"Using $$a and $$b"))
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * On evaluation the above prints:
 * {{{
 *   Acquiring outer
 *   Acquiring inner
 *   Using outer and inner
 *   Releasing inner
 *   Releasing outer
 * }}}
 *
 * A `Resource` can also lift arbitrary actions that don't require finalisation through
 * [[Resource.eval eval]]. Actions passed to `eval` preserve their interruptibility.
 *
 * Finally, `Resource` partakes in other abstractions such as `MonadError`, `Parallel`, and
 * `Monoid`, so make sure to explore those instances as well as the other methods not covered
 * here.
 *
 * `Resource` is encoded as a data structure, an ADT, described by the following node types:
 *
 *   - [[Resource.Allocate Allocate]]
 *   - [[Resource.Bind Bind]]
 *   - [[Resource.Pure Pure]]
 *   - [[Resource.Eval Eval]]
 *
 * Normally users don't need to care about these node types, unless conversions from `Resource`
 * into something else is needed (e.g. conversion from `Resource` into a streaming data type),
 * in which case they can be interpreted through pattern matching.
 *
 * @tparam F
 *   the effect type in which the resource is allocated and released
 * @tparam A
 *   the type of resource
