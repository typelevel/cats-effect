/**
 * A purely functional synchronization primitive which represents a single value which may not
 * yet be available.
 *
 * When created, a `Deferred` is empty. It can then be completed exactly once, and never be made
 * empty again.
 *
 * `get` on an empty `Deferred` will block until the `Deferred` is completed. `get` on a
 * completed `Deferred` will always immediately return its content.
 *
 * `complete(a)` on an empty `Deferred` will set it to `a`, notify any and all readers currently
 * blocked on a call to `get`, and return true. `complete(a)` on a `Deferred` that has already
 * been completed will not modify its content, and return false.
 *
 * Albeit simple, `Deferred` can be used in conjunction with [[Ref]] to build complex concurrent
 * behaviour and data structures like queues and semaphores.
 *
 * Finally, the blocking mentioned above is semantic only, no actual threads are blocked by the
 * implementation.
