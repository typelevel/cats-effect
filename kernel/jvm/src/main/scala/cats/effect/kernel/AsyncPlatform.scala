   * @note
   *   Cancelation is cooperative and it is up to the `CompletableFuture` to respond to the
   *   request by handling cancelation appropriately and indicating that it has done so. This
   *   means that if the `CompletableFuture` indicates that it did not cancel, there will be no
   *   "fire-and-forget" semantics. Instead, to satisfy backpressure guarantees, the
   *   `CompletableFuture` will be treated as if it is uncancelable and the fiber will fallback
   *   to waiting for it to complete.
