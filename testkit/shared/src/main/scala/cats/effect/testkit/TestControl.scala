/**
 * Implements a fully functional single-threaded runtime for a [[cats.effect.IO]] program. When
 * using this control system, `IO` programs will be executed on a single JVM thread, ''similar''
 * to how they would behave if the production runtime were configured to use a single worker
 * thread regardless of underlying physical thread count. The results of the underlying `IO`
 * will be produced by the [[results]] effect when ready, but nothing will actually evaluate
 * until one of the ''tick'' effects on this class are sequenced. If the desired behavior is to
 * simply run the `IO` fully to completion within the mock environment, respecting monotonic
 * time, then [[tickAll]] is likely the desired effect (or, alternatively,
 * [[TestControl.executeEmbed]]).
 *
 * In other words, `TestControl` is sort of like a "handle" to the runtime internals within the
 * context of a specific `IO`'s execution. It makes it possible for users to manipulate and
 * observe the execution of the `IO` under test from an external vantage point. It is important
 * to understand that the ''outer'' `IO`s (e.g. those returned by the [[tick]] or [[results]]
 * methods) are ''not'' running under the test control environment, and instead they are meant
 * to be run by some outer runtime. Interactions between the outer runtime and the inner runtime
 * (potentially via mechanisms like [[cats.effect.std.Queue]] or
 * [[cats.effect.kernel.Deferred]]) are quite tricky and should only be done with extreme care.
 * The likely outcome in such scenarios is that the `TestControl` runtime will detect the inner
 * `IO` as being deadlocked whenever it is actually waiting on the external runtime. This could
 * result in strange effects such as [[tickAll]] or `executeEmbed` terminating early. Do not
 * construct such scenarios unless you're very confident you understand the implications of what
 * you're doing.
 *
 * Where things ''differ'' from a single-threaded production runtime is in two critical areas.
 *
 * First, whenever multiple fibers are outstanding and ready to be resumed, the `TestControl`
 * runtime will ''randomly'' choose between them, rather than taking them in a first-in,
 * first-out fashion as the default production runtime will. This semantic is intended to
 * simulate different scheduling interleavings, ensuring that race conditions are not
 * accidentally masked by deterministic execution order.
 *
 * Second, within the context of the `TestControl`, ''time'' is very carefully and artificially
 * controlled. In a sense, this runtime behaves as if it is executing on a single CPU which
 * performs all operations infinitely fast. Any fibers which are immediately available for
 * execution will be executed until no further fibers are available to run (assuming the use of
 * `tickAll`). Through this entire process, the current clock (which is exposed to the program
 * via [[IO.realTime]] and [[IO.monotonic]]) will remain fixed at the very beginning, meaning
 * that no time is considered to have elapsed as a consequence of ''compute''.
 *
 * Note that the above means that it is relatively easy to create a deadlock on this runtime
 * with a program which would not deadlock on either the JVM or JavaScript:
 *
 * {{{
 *   // do not do this!
 *   IO.cede.foreverM.timeout(10.millis)
 * }}}
 *
 * The above program spawns a fiber which yields forever, setting a timeout for 10 milliseconds
 * which is ''intended'' to bring the loop to a halt. However, because the immediate task queue
 * will never be empty, the test runtime will never advance time, meaning that the 10
 * milliseconds will never elapse and the timeout will not be hit. This will manifest as the
 * [[tick]] and [[tickAll]] effects simply running forever and not returning if called.
 * [[tickOne]] is safe to call on the above program, but it will always produce `true`.
 *
 * In order to advance time, you must use the [[advance]] effect to move the clock forward by a
 * specified offset (which must be greater than 0). If you use the `tickAll` effect, the clock
 * will be automatically advanced by the minimum amount necessary to reach the next pending
 * task. For example, if the program contains an [[IO.sleep]] for `500.millis`, and there are no
 * shorter sleeps, then time will need to be advanced by 500 milliseconds in order to make that
 * fiber eligible for execution.
 *
 * At this point, the process repeats until all tasks are exhausted. If the program has reached
 * a concluding value or exception, then it will be produced from the `unsafeRun` method which
 * scheduled the `IO` on the runtime (pro tip: do ''not'' use `unsafeRunSync` with this runtime,
 * since it will always result in immediate deadlock). If the program does ''not'' produce a
 * result but also has no further work to perform (such as a program like [[IO.never]]), then
 * `tickAll` will return but no result will have been produced by the `unsafeRun`. If this
 * happens, [[isDeadlocked]] will return `true` and the program is in a "hung" state. This same
 * situation on the production runtime would have manifested as an asynchronous deadlock.
 *
 * You should ''never'' use this runtime in a production code path. It is strictly meant for
 * testing purposes, particularly testing programs that involve time functions and [[IO.sleep]].
 *
 * Due to the semantics of this runtime, time will behave entirely consistently with a plausible
 * production execution environment provided that you ''never'' observe time via side-effects,
 * and exclusively through the [[IO.realTime]], [[IO.monotonic]], and [[IO.sleep]] functions
 * (and other functions built on top of these). From the perspective of these functions, all
 * computation is infinitely fast, and the only effect which advances time is [[IO.sleep]] (or
 * if something external, such as the test harness, sequences the [[advance]] effect). However,
 * an effect such as `IO(System.currentTimeMillis())` will "see through" the illusion, since the
 * system clock is unaffected by this runtime. This is one reason why it is important to always
 * and exclusively rely on `realTime` and `monotonic`, either directly on `IO` or via the
 * typeclass abstractions.
 *
 * WARNING: ''Never'' use this runtime on programs which use the [[IO#evalOn]] method! The test
 * runtime will detect this situation as an asynchronous deadlock.

   *
   * This is very subtle, but the problem is that time is advanced ''before'' the [[IO.sleep]]

   * the runtime, it is scheduled for the time offset equal to `1.second + 100.millis`, since
   * time was already advanced `1.second` before it had a chance to submit. Of course, time has
   * only been advanced by `1.second`, thus the `sleep` never completes and the `println` cannot
   * ever run.
