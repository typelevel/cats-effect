  /* setSeed has no effect. For cryptographically secure PRNGs, giving a seed
   * can only ever increase the entropy. It is never allowed to decrease it.
   * Given that we don't have access to an API to strengthen the entropy of the
   * underlying PRNG, it's fine to ignore it instead.
   *
   * Note that the doc of `SecureRandom` says that it will seed itself upon
   * first call to `nextBytes` or `next`, if it has not been seeded yet. This
   * suggests that an *initial* call to `setSeed` would make a `SecureRandom`
   * instance deterministic. Experimentally, this does not seem to be the case,
   * however, so we don't spend extra effort to make that happen.
