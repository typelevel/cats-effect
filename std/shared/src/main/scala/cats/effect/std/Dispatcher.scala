/**
 * A fiber-based supervisor utility for evaluating effects across an impure boundary. This is
 * useful when working with reactive interfaces that produce potentially many values (as opposed
 * to one), and for each value, some effect in `F` must be performed (like inserting each value
 * into a queue).
 *
 * [[Dispatcher]] is a kind of [[Supervisor]] and accordingly follows the same scoping and
 * lifecycle rules with respect to submitted effects.
 *
 * Performance note: all clients of a single [[Dispatcher]] instance will contend with each
 * other when submitting effects. However, [[Dispatcher]] instances are cheap to create and have
 * minimal overhead, so they can be allocated on-demand if necessary.
 *
 * Notably, [[Dispatcher]] replaces Effect and ConcurrentEffect from Cats Effect 2 while only
 * requiring an [[cats.effect.kernel.Async]] constraint.

   * This corresponds to a [[Dispatcher]] mode in which submitted actions are evaluated strictly

   * [[Dispatcher.unsafeRunAndForget]] are guaranteed to run in exactly the order submitted, and
   * subsequent actions will not start evaluation until previous actions are completed. This
   * avoids a significant amount of overhead associated with the [[Parallel]] mode and allows
   * callers to make assumptions around ordering, but the downside is that long-running actions
   * will starve subsequent actions, and all submitters must contend for a singular coordination
   * resource. Thus, this mode is most appropriate for cases where the actions are relatively
   * trivial (such as [[Queue.offer]]) ''and'' the `Dispatcher` in question is ''not'' shared
