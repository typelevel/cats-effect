/**
 * A fiber-based supervisor utility for evaluating effects across an impure boundary. This is
 * useful when working with reactive interfaces that produce potentially many values (as opposed
 * to one), and for each value, some effect in `F` must be performed (like inserting each value
 * into a queue).
 *
 * [[Dispatcher]] is a kind of [[Supervisor]] and accordingly follows the same scoping and
 * lifecycle rules with respect to submitted effects.
 *
 * Performance note: all clients of a single [[Dispatcher]] instance will contend with each
 * other when submitting effects. However, [[Dispatcher]] instances are cheap to create and have
 * minimal overhead, so they can be allocated on-demand if necessary.
 *
 * Notably, [[Dispatcher]] replaces Effect and ConcurrentEffect from Cats Effect 2 while only
 * requiring an [[cats.effect.kernel.Async]] constraint.

  /*
   * There are three fundamental modes here: sequential, parallel, and sequential-cancelable. There
   * is very little overlap in semantics between the three apart from the submission side. The whole thing is split up into
   * a submission queue with impure enqueue and cancel functions which is drained by the `Worker` and an
   * internal execution protocol which also involves a queue. The `Worker` encapsulates all of the
   * race conditions and negotiations with impure code, while the `Executor` manages running the
   * tasks with appropriate semantics. In parallel mode, we shard the `Worker`s according to the
   * number of CPUs and select a random queue (in impure code) as a target. This reduces contention
   * at the cost of ordering, which is not guaranteed in parallel mode. With the sequential modes, there
   * is only a single worker.
   *
   * On the impure side, the queue bit is the easy part: it's just a `UnsafeUnbounded` (queue) which
   * accepts Registration(s). It's easiest to think of this a bit like an actor model, where the
   * `Worker` is the actor and the enqueue is the send. Whenever we send a unit of work, that
   * message has an `AtomicReference` which allows us to back-propagate a cancelation action. That
   * cancelation action can be used in impure code by sending it back to us using the Finalizer
   * message. There are certain race conditions involved in canceling work on the queue and work
   * which is in the process of being taken off the queue, and those race conditions are negotiated
   * between the impure code and the `Worker`.
   *
   * On the pure side, the three different `Executor`s are very distinct. In parallel mode, it's easy:
   * we have a separate `Supervisor` which doesn't respawn actions, and we use that supervisor to
   * spawn a new fiber for each task unit. Cancelation in this mode is easy: we just cancel the fiber.
   *
   * Sequential mode is the simplest of all: all work is executed in-place and cannot be canceled.
   * The cancelation action in all cases is simply `unit` because the impure submission will not be
   * seen until after the work is completed *anyway*, so there's no point in being fancy.
   *
   * For sequential-cancelable mode, we spawn a *single* executor fiber on the main supervisor (which respawns).
   * This fiber is paired with a pure unbounded queue and a shutoff latch. New work is placed on the
   * queue, which the fiber takes from in order and executes in-place. If the work self-cancels or
   * errors, the executor will be restarted. In the case of external cancelation, we shut off the
   * latch (to hold new work), drain the entire work queue into a scratch space, then cancel the
   * executor fiber in-place so long as we're sure it's actively working on the target task. Once
   * that cancelation completes (which will ultimately restart the executor fiber), we re-fill the
   * queue and unlock the latch to allow new work (from the `Worker`).
